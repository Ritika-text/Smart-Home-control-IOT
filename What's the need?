 You might just think 
that the idea of smart home would promote laziness. 
Though this project can help many elderly and disabled 
people who struggle even with simple household tasks. 
Home automation can be the difference for these 
people to love happy and independently in their own 
home. And not only to them, this idea brings benefits to 
all of us too. It provides us with better security, 
comfort, convenience and quality of life. So, the idea is 
not to promote laziness but to promote easy 
accessibility and quality of life
