Smart Home is the building of automation.
It provides you access to all sorts of information with a click of a button.
It makes our life comfortable, safe and convenient.
A smart home will control lighting, climate, door locks and other appliances. 
It may also include home security such as smart locks etc. 
These when connected to internet contribute towards being an important part of
Internet of things .
A home automation typically connects controlled 
devices to a central hub or “gateway”. The user 
interface for control of the system uses either wall
mounted terminals, tablet or desktop computers, a 
mobile phone application, or a Web interface, that may 
also be accessible off-site through the internet.
While there are many competing vendors, there are 
very few worldwide accepted industry standards and 
the smart home space is heavily fragmented. 
Manufacturers often prevent independent 
implementations by withholding documentation and by 
litigation. 
There are a lot of applications of Smart Home control. 
Some of the applications are given below: 
• Lighting Control System: A “smart” network that 
incorporates communication between various lighting 
system, using one or more than one computing devices. 
• Heating, Air Conditioning: It is possible to have 
remote control of all home energy monitors over the 
internet incorporating a simple and friendly user 
interface. 
• Security: Home automation can also provide security 
services like remote surveillance of security cameras 
over the internet and central locking of all perimeter 
doors and windows. 
• Leakage Detection: We can also detect smoke using 
CO detectors.
