The project is a Smart Home that can detect when 
a person enters and so turns on the lights and fans 
for that person. 
• Two IR sensors are used on the door that can emit 
Infrared Rays to detect the presence of the person. 
The sequence of detection allows them to 
understand whether a person is entering or leaving 
the house. If the sensor present outside detects 
first and then the one present inside then the 
person is entering the house and vice versa.
• Once the person enters the house, it tells the 
number of people based on the number of 
detections. And also turns on the lights and fans 
for that person. The DHT 22 sensor detects the 
temperature and so tells whether there is need of 
the fan or not. As the fan switches on if the 
temperature detected is above the threshold value.
• This data through cloud is sent to our smartphones 
so we know when and how many people are 
entering our house easily
